# CS-370-Portfolio

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  In this project I was given some placeholder code for a treasure hunt game where an agent (pirate) would attempt to traverse a maze and reach the end to win the game. Most of the code was already in place to determine the win conditions of the game and to set up the basics. I was tasked with implementing a machine learning algorithm to help the agent determine the best path to take. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  A computer scientist solves problems using programming and software to aid them in their problem solving. They matter because technology 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  I approach most problems by pausing and taking a look at the whole picture first. Then I try to break the problem into the smallest applicable pieces so each problem is attainable to solve. I would then prioritize each of the sections. From that point I would start attempting to solve the problem. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  The ethical responsibilities of an end user is to only use the software in the ways intended by the organization. Also to attempt to do no harm to other users or the organizations by using it. The ethical responsibility of the organization is to protect all user data and ensure a safe and secure environment for users to use.
